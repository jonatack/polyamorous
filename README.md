# Polyamorous

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/jonatack/polyamorous.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/jonatack/polyamorous)

This Polyamorous fork is intended to be compatible with the [Rails master branch](https://github.com/rails/rails) which is currently targeting Rails 4.1 beta. 

No backwards compatibility with earlier Rails branches or versions is guaranteed (or likely).

The original Polyamorous gem is [https://github.com/ernie/polyamorous](https://github.com/ernie/polyamorous).

## Getting started
